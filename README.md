# CBDQ-Template
Just a simple template for anyone that wanna create a CBDQ bot


Some functions:
{img hyperlink} calls an image as long as it directs to an image that is valid

{vid vidlink} calls a video file, can take from twitter as long as it ends in "/video/1"

\n is a line break

There's also SVG functions but I don't know how to set them up. Read them in the main page of cheapbotsdonequick.com
